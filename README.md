## Motivation
Since years SAP customers invested heavily into custom developments related to the SAP Business Suite. In the SAP S/4HANA a lot of SAP code was simplified and, in some cases, changed in a not compatible way (e.g. remove of database tables, data types and data model changes). Therefore, during system conversion from a SAP ERP system to SAP S/4HANA custom code needs to be adapted. The Simplification Database stores and describes all incompatible changes of the SAP code in SAP S/4HANA including the guidance (via SAP Notes) how the related custom code can be adapted. SAP provides tools based on the Simplification Database to detect custom code, which needs to be adapted to SAP S/4HANA and carry out functional adaptation.

Custom Code Migration is part of the system conversion process from the classic SAP Business Suite running on any database to the SAP S/4HANA system. In the context of this system conversion, custom ABAP code needs to be adapted, since a lot of SAP code within SAP S/4HANA was simplified and in some cases changed in a non-compatible way.

Custom Code Migration refers to the process of analyzing and adapting existing custom ABAP code to ensure its readiness for SAP S/4HANA. This process involves several steps and tools to facilitate the migration and ensure compatibility with the target environment.
<img alt="table" src="images//Picture1.png" width="100%">
Some of your custom code objects are not valid anymore and either do not perform as expected or produce syntax errors or dumps (red objects in the picture). You almost certainly have other objects that do perform as expected and do not need to be changed (green objects in the picture).
SAP provides tools, based on the Simplification Database, that detect any custom code that needs to be adapted to SAP S/4HANA. The Simplification Database is a database table in the SAP S/4HANA system that contains all Simplification Items that refer to SAP objects simplified in SAP S/4HANA. Each simplification item describes changed or removed SAP objects and refers to a dedicated SAP Note that describes the impact of the change and how the related custom code can be adapted.

To analyze the required adaptations, you need to set up a system based on SAP NetWeaver AS for ABAP 7.52 that operates as a Central Check System. Using this Central Check System, you can perform remote custom code checks in ABAP Test Cockpit (ATC) for one or more systems in your landscape. 

This material focuses on the custom code related process, from checking custom code remotely, then analyzing the findings, and finally adapting the custom code. Read this guide carefully to get instructions on how to adapt your custom code to SAP S/4HANA 1909.

## Overview of the Conversion Process
SAP provides a process for the system conversion to SAP S/4HANA. The following figure gives you an overview of the tools, the phases, and the activities involved in the process.
<img alt="table" src="images//Picture2.png" width="100%">
The Custom Code Migration process describes the tools and necessary activities that help you to migrate custom code. The process consists of preparatory analysis (Custom Code Analysis) and the adaptation of the custom code (Custom Code Adaptation) after the technical conversion.


## Key Aspects of Custom Code Adaptation
To prepare the system conversion, we recommend that you evaluate your custom code and remove any obsolete code as indicated in the Usage Procedure Log (UPL/SCMON). For more information, see ABAP Call Monitor (SCMON) ‚Äì Analyze usage of your code.
In addition, your custom code needs to be checked with ABAP Test Cockpit (ATC) against the SAP S/4HANA simplifications in the Simplification Database and for any SAP HANA related changes. The result is a list of findings where your custom code does not comply with the scope and data structure of SAP S/4HANA. At this step you can estimate the required effort required to adapt custom code to migrate to SAP S/4HANA.

#### Types of Projects
One essential part the Custom Code Adaptation is the Custom Code Migration Fiori App. The Custom Code Migration app enables you to create three different kinds of projects:
1. **SAP S/4HANA Migration Project:** Analyze custom code that shall be migrated from an existing product like SAP Business Suite to a new product such as SAP S/4HANA 2023. It performs SAP S/4HANA custom code checks to evaluate the custom objects to be adapted.
2. **SAP BTP Analysis Project:** Analyze custom code for readiness to run in SAP BTP ABAP environment.
3. **Custom Code Analysis Project:** Analyze custom code with arbitrary ATC check variants. This includes performing dependency and complexity analyses.

#### Migration Process
1. **Code Analysis:** The custom code migration process analyzes your existing code for cloud-readiness. Tools like the Custom Code Migration app and ABAP Test Cockpit (ATC) are used to identify functional or security vulnerabilities in your ABAP source code.
2. **Adapting Code:** After analyzing the code, necessary changes are made to adapt the code for the target environment.

####  Additional Information
Unused Code Identification: The Custom Code Migration app supports identifying unused custom code based on collected usage data, enabling the removal of unused code during system conversion to SAP S/4HANA.
