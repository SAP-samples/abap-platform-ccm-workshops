<!-- Exercise Description -->
The Custom Code Migration Fiori Application enables you to analyze your custom code that needs to be migrated from an SAP Business Suite system to SAP S/4HANA (on-premise). To evaluate the development objects to be adopted, it performs the S/4HANA custom code checks. 

In addition, this app supports you with identifying unused custom code based on your collected usage data. This enables you to remove unused custom code during a system conversion to SAP S/4HANA. 


The Custom Code Migration app serves several purposes:

**1. SAP S/4HANA Migration Project**
* It analyzes custom code that needs to be migrated from an existing product like SAP Business Suite to a new product such as SAP S/4HANA 2023.
* It performs SAP S/4HANA custom code checks to evaluate the custom objects that need to be adapted 

**2. SAP BTP Analysis Project**
* It analyzes custom code for readiness to run in the SAP BTP ABAP environment 

**3. Custom Code Analysis Project**
* It analyzes custom code with arbitrary ATC check variants.
* It helps in identifying unused custom code based on collected usage data, enabling the removal of unused custom code during a system conversion to SAP S/4HANA 

Additionally, the app supports the migration of existing custom ABAP code for add-on development purposes by analyzing the code for cloud-readiness and enabling migration via abapGit.

More detailed information, you can refer to the following resources:

### Key Features

Create Project with or without Usage Data:

**Scoping**
* You define which ABAP custom code needs to be migrated to be taken over to SAP S/4HANA (based on usage data)
* This app creates a deletion transport in order to delete unused ABAP source code during the system conversion to SAP S/4HANA

**Analysis of SAP S/4HANAcustom code check findings**
* Analytical representation of SAP S/4HANA custom code check findings
* Results can be filtered by scope and usage data

**Save Scope as Transport Request**
* Transport request to be added to the Software Update Manager for the S/4 conversion

---
1.    Logon to the Central Check System (S/4 HANA 2023 System).Use the provided logon information for system.
      <img src="images//Picture1.png" width="50%">
   
---
2. Start your Fiori Launchpad by using transaction /UI2/FLP

      Logon to the system:

      User: DEVELOPER##
      
      Pwd: Welcome1!

      <img src="images//Picture2.png" width="50%">

---
3. Create a Project. Launch the Custom Code Migration app to analyze which custom code has to be adapted if we convert our system A4H to SAP S/4HANA 2023.

      Use the RFC Destination: **```ERP***```
      to connect to our ERP development system.

      Donâ€™t miss to add the usage data which is available in system A4H.

---
4. Create a new Project    
      <img src="images//Picture3.png" width="50%">

---
5. Enter appropriate data     
      <img src="images//Picture4.png" width="50%">

---
6.    Add Usage Data from the A4H system by using the F4 help.    
      <img src="images//Picture5.png" width="50%">

---
7.    Select the last entry   
      <img src="images//Picture6.png" width="50%">

---
8.    Save your project       
      <img src="images//Picture7.png" width="50%">

---
9.    **Refresh** your project from time to time to see the progress.       
      <img src="images//Picture8.png" width="50%">

#### Custom Code Migration - Scoping

---

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ”µ Click to expand to see the exercise</summary>

---
10.    We donâ€™t want to take-over all custom code to S/4HANA. Please change the scope and remove following objects:
* ```Z_CCM_ADJUST_CURRENCY_CODE_##```
* ```Z_CCM_SALES_DOC_COUNTER_##```

---
11. To remove the ojects **Navigate** to the Scope Overview       
      <img src="images//Picture12.png" width="70%">

---
12.   **Filter** for your development objects using the F4-Help of the:

      * Request Entry Point with the search field located in your exercise package
        * Z_CCM_EX_##
  
      <img src="images//Picture13.png" width="70%">
      <img src="images//Picture14.png" width="70%">
      <img src="images//Picture15.png" width="70%">

---
13.   Sort your list by the field 

      Last Usage in ascending order

      <img src="images//Picture16.png" width="70%">

---
14.   Group your list by

      Last Usage

      <img src="images//Picture17.png" width="70%">
---
15.   Remove all applications which have not been used in 2019 from the scope.

      <img src="images//Picture18.png" width="70%">

---
16.   Because there is a New Development Project ongoing and since there is no usage data currently available. Therefore, start the Scope Packages app and navigate to the package

      Z_CCM_EPM

      <img src="images//Picture19.png" width="70%">

---
17.   As you can see not all objects are taken into account by default.

      Add the package to the scope.

1.    **Analysis with the Analytical List Page**
    
      We want to start the effort estimation for our custom code adaptation. As far as we understood we should have the following numbers in place:
2.    How many findings do we have overall?   
            <img src="images//Picture21.png" width="50%">
3.    How many findings are related to the custom code objects we take over to SAP S/4HANA?
            <img src="images//Picture22.png" width="50%">
4.    How many findings can be fixed using quick fixes?   
            <img src="images//Picture23.png" width="50%">
5.    What are the top 3 areas (i.e., which SAP Note numbers) we have findings?   
            <img src="images//Picture24.png" width="50%">
6.    Which package do we have the most findings?   
            <img src="images//Picture25.png" width="50%">
5. Next task is to provide a list of all findings in Excel.       
      <img src="images//Picture26.png" width="50%">

1.    Finally, after all the scoping and analysis tasks lets create a transport request which is taken into the SUM for the S/4HANA conversion.information for system.  
      <img src="images//Picture27.png" width="50%">
2.    Navigate back to the A4H system and check if all scoped objects are missing (because this is a deletion request)?
