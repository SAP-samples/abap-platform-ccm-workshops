<!-- Exercise Description -->
### Introduction
The ABAP Call Monitor is a tool designed to help you examine the performance of your implemented business logic in the ABAP environment. It allows you to:

The Usage Data allows you to aggregate and manage data of the ABAP Call Monitor.

Identify runtime-intensive statements: By using function modules and global ABAP classes, you can pinpoint statements that consume significant runtime.
Follow the hierarchy of program calls: The ABAP trace, which is the result of the ABAP Profiler, helps you trace the sequence of program calls, providing a detailed view of the execution flow.

### You will learn  
- How to use transaction /SDF/SCMON to collect runtime data about which custom code objects are being executed.
- How to analyze collected data using tools like the Call Graph and Log Browser to understand program behavior and identify potential issues.
- How to use transaction SUSG to aggregate and manage the collected usage data, create snapshots, and export them for further analysis.

#### Summary

**You learned how to:**

- üîç **Use Transaction /SDF/SCMON to Collect Runtime Data**
  - This transaction monitors which custom code objects are executed during normal system usage.
  - It captures runtime usage data at the ABAP statement level, helping identify actively used custom code.
  - Ideal for usage-based custom code analysis during S/4HANA readiness checks.
- üß† **Analyze Data with Call Graph and Log Browser**
  - Use the Call Graph to visualize the execution flow of programs and understand dependencies.
  - The Log Browser helps inspect detailed runtime logs, making it easier to:
    - Trace program behavior
    - Identify performance bottlenecks
    - Spot unused or rarely used code
- üìä **Use Transaction SUSG to Aggregate and Manage Usage Data**
  - SUSG allows you to:
    - Aggregate collected SCMON data
    - Create snapshots of usage data for specific timeframes
    - Export data for further analysis or archiving
  - Useful for long-term monitoring and custom code optimization.
